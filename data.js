We have a lot to choose from. Find it all here:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/dbsoule?ref=hdr_shop_menu\u00a7ion_id=19840445\n\nWe are happy to offer this unique ring made with charred wood taken from Jack Daniels Whiskey Barrels. Each ring is handmade to order and will have a unique look. Your ring will truly be one of a kind. You can choose your size as well as the width.\n\n\nNotes on our process:\n\nWe start with reclaimed wood from Jack Daniels Whiskey Barrels. We drill a hole close to your ring size and then continue to bore out the hole until the true ring size is reached. Once that is complete we use various tools and techniques to shape the outside of the ring. After we achieve a basic ring shape we then round the edges for a better look and a more comfortable fit.\n\nFrom there we fine sand the ring using various grits of sandpaper all the way up to 2000 grit. Finally, we apply no less than six coats of protective finish and buff your new ring several times to unsure the best shine and smoothest possible finish.\n\nNotes on strength and care:\n\nAvoid wearing your ring in the shower, while doing dishes, while swimming, or doing other activities that have prolonged exposure to water or chemicals. Avoid applying weight to the ring, and also avoid pressing it between your fingers in a test of strength ;)\n\nCare for the ring is simple. Light buffing with a microfiber cloth keeps it looking nice. If you want to add a little shine, buff it with a little bit of olive oil. A gentle buffing compound can also be used.\n\nNote that exposure to sunlight can change the color of your ring over time. Wood evolves, and its evolution is powered by the sun.\n\n\nNote on sizing:\n\nOur rings are available in sizes 4 - 13, including half sizes. We offer varying widths in ranges of 2mm.

The large illuminated initial complements the sayings, which have been carefully laid out in a font that has been selected for a complete, balanced design. For this set, I use glasses that are Made In America.\n\nSold in sets of four glasses. Also available as a set of six, with two additional Blessings.\n\nThe blessings texts are:\n\n &quot;May you have warm words on a cold evening,  a full moon on a dark night, and the road downhill all the way to your door&quot;.\n\n&quot;May good luck be your friend, in whatever you do. And may trouble be always a stranger to you&quot;.\n\n&quot;May your troubles be less, and your blessings be more, and nothing but happiness come through your door&quot;.\n\n&quot;May God grant you many years to live, for he must be knowing, The Earth has angels all too few, And heaven is overflowing&quot;.\n\nEach set is prepared to order, and can be personalized with your own words or an additional message if you prefer at no extra cost. The engraved area width varies with each saying, but the engraved height is 35mm (1.4 inches) in the examples shown in the photos. There is room for a larger design on the glass, but this is a good guideline for composition.","creation_tsz":1476470505,"ending_tsz":1487101305,"original_creation_tsz":1371500042,"last_modified_tsz":1476470505,"price":"40.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":12,"tags":["laser etched","glass","whisky glass","whiskey  glass","Irish Blessing","Irish Saying","glassware gifts","engraved glass"],"category_path":["Housewares"],"category_path_ids":[69150425],"materials":["glass"],"shop_section_id":17306531,"featured_rank":3,"state_tsz":1462832335,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/154268667\/four-irish-whiskey-glasses-traditional?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":2494,"num_favorers":145,"shipping_template_id":12542394298,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"56","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"9","item_width":"9","item_height":"9","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1054,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Kitchen & Dining","Drink & Barware"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":969778438,"hex_code":"5A595B","red":90,"green":89,"blue":91,"hue":270,"saturation":2,"brightness":35,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1462395979,"listing_id":154268667,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/8257855\/il_75x75.969778438_a06n.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/8257855\/il_170x135.969778438_a06n.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/8257855\/il_570xN.969778438_a06n.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/8257855\/il_fullxfull.969778438_a06n.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":969778632,"hex_code":"454346","red":69,"green":67,"blue":70,"hue":280,"saturation":4,"brightness":27,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1462395979,"listing_id":154268667,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/137\/0\/8257855\/il_75x75.969778632_8gmn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/137\/0\/8257855\/il_170x135.969778632_8gmn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/137\/0\/8257855\/il_570xN.969778632_8gmn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/137\/0\/8257855\/il_fullxfull.969778632_8gmn.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":470461594,"hex_code":"7B7B7B","red":123,"green":123,"blue":123,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":48,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1371499630,"listing_id":154268667,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_75x75.470461594_k8r9.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_170x135.470461594_k8r9.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_570xN.470461594_k8r9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_fullxfull.470461594_k8r9.jpg","full_height":771,"full_width":729},{"listing_image_id":470461774,"hex_code":"7D7D7D","red":125,"green":125,"blue":125,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":49,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1371499630,"listing_id":154268667,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_75x75.470461774_51u4.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_170x135.470461774_51u4.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_570xN.470461774_51u4.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/8257855\/il_fullxfull.470461774_51u4.jpg","full_height":780,"full_width":780},{"listing_image_id":537774735,"hex_code":"535C7B","red":83,"green":92,"blue":123,"hue":226,"saturation":32,"brightness":48,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1386537194,"listing_id":154268667,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/8257855\/il_75x75.537774735_f15i.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/8257855\/il_170x135.537774735_f15i.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/8257855\/il_570xN.537774735_f15i.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/8257855\/il_fullxfull.537774735_f15i.jpg","full_height":816,"full_width":1228}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8257855,"shop_name":"LaserArtGifts","user_id":7378900,"creation_tsz":1371500042,"title":"Turning Ideas into Reality with a dash of Laser Light","announcement":"Old-fashioned craftsmanship with 21st Century tools.

The Godmother requires Ariel Rounded UNDER the design & The Godfather requires Brush script under the design - these may NOT be changed.\n\nPlease look over our ABOUT page which describes some of the subtle differences between our unique designs.  \n\nCall us anytime at 775-848-2831775-848-2831  or visit us at http:\/\/www.GodparentBaptismGifts.com\n\nAt your service,\n\nJohnny (ManhattanDon)\n\nBack to my shop: http:\/\/www.GodparentBaptismGift.etsy.com\n\nVisit our shop policies for more information on purchasing from GodparentBaptismGift: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/GodparentBaptismGift\/policy","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"PLEASE  VISIT  US  AT   http:\/\/godfatherbaptismgifts.com\/","sale_message":"Thank you for your order with Gifts for Godparents!

International orders are not guaranteed by a certain delivery date, as this is impossible due to international customs.  Your order will ship on it&#39;s scheduled ship date as stated on your Etsy invoice, and the arrival date will depend on the USPS and the customs and local mail of your country.  Once your order is due for shipping, the actual shipping time will be between 2 to 8 weeks for international. - Please allow up to a least 8 weeks for arrival once shipped for international.\r\nSorry tracking is not available for International customers in some countries, as the USPS only offers tracking service for limited international countries.  Orders will be sent internationally with first class mail, therefore if the USPS is not offering tracking to your particular country, then I cannot offer it to you since I am using there service.  Please be aware of this prior to your purchase, as some international packages can not be tracked on route.  An international packages is assigned a  CN-22 Customs Declaration number (which is proof of shipping,)  but does NOT track the package on it&#39;s journey for some countries.  I CANNOT track and international package in transit if it is not offered, please bare this in mind please PRIOR to purchase, thank you.\r\n\r\nPatience is needed if an international package is delayed or stuck in customs, if you do not have the time to wait for an international package to arrive then I advise you to please not order from this shop,  I have outlined very clearly how international shipping works and the timeframe that this may take, I have no control over international shipping, custom officials, and the timeframe that this may take.  Custom delays are a part of international shipping, if this upsets you then it is best not to order as delays may occur, this could mean that your package could possibly miss the day that you want\/ need the item by if you have not ordered in enough time, (the time that I state,)   Please understand that I cannot guarantee the arrival date of an international package, so if you cannot wait for the package to arrive or do not order in time (as stated above,) please do NOT order here, thank you so kindly.\r\n\r\nIMPORT DUTY TAXES - Also pleased be advised that your international country may also assess import duty\/taxes to your items you have purchased, (your package,)  this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes or duty fees associated with the package.   This is not a shipping charge, it is an import tax imposed by your country that you may have to pay to your country depending on the rules and regulations of your country, and the total purchase price of your package,  I have very few packages that are charged a customs fee, but it can and does happen, please be aware of this prior to your purchase, I will NOT pay for custom charges, this is the responsibility if the customer to pay.  You must pay this import tax fee if your country applies this fee to your package if you wish to receive your package.   Seller will NOT pay import taxes for the customer,  as this in NOT a shipping charge, this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes that are applied by your county.    Please check with your local customs before placing an order if you do not wish to pay import or duty taxes to see if they apply for what you are ordering, the amount, or by your country&#39;s rules.   Returns and refunds will not be accepted due to a customer who refuses to pay import taxes  if your country decides to apply taxes to your package.

Custom delays are a part of international shipping, if this upsets you then it is best not to order as delays may occur, this could mean that your package could possibly miss the day that you want\/ need the item by if you have not ordered in enough time, (the time that I state,)   Please understand that I cannot guarantee the arrival date of an international package, so if you cannot wait for the package to arrive or do not order in time (as stated above,) please do NOT order here, thank you so kindly.\r\n\r\nIMPORT DUTY TAXES - Also pleased be advised that your international country may also assess import duty\/taxes to your items you have purchased, (your package,)  this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes or duty fees associated with the package.   This is not a shipping charge, it is an import tax imposed by your country that you may have to pay to your country depending on the rules and regulations of your country, and the total purchase price of your package,  I have very few packages that are charged a customs fee, but it can and does happen, please be aware of this prior to your purchase, I will NOT pay for custom charges, this is the responsibility if the customer to pay.  You must pay this import tax fee if your country applies this fee to your package if you wish to receive your package.   Seller will NOT pay import taxes for the customer,  as this in NOT a shipping charge, this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes that are applied by your county.    Please check with your local customs before placing an order if you do not wish to pay import or duty taxes to see if they apply for what you are ordering, the amount, or by your country&#39;s rules.   Returns and refunds will not be accepted due to a customer who refuses to pay import taxes  if your country decides to apply taxes to your package.  \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL countries that can take longer than usual for shipping include but are not limited to AUSTRALIA, and CANADA,  ASIAN countries, and BRAZIL.   These countries in particular BRAZIL and some ASAIN countries can take TWO to THREE MONTH + in some cases, or longer sometimes for shipping, Please allow at least 2 to 3 MONTHS for shipping to these countries and order accordingly based on the above timeframes.    Brazil in particular has very difficult and long customs clearance, so please be advised. Other countries may also be included in this longer than usual timeframe.    \r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions regarding shipping, please do not hesitate to contact me via Etsy&#39;s convo system.\r\n\r\n**Please note: Once the package leaves my hands I have no control of how long the package takes to get to your destination, factors such as customs, weather and postal errors within the mail system that are out of my hands and could delay a package.**\r\n\r\n**Not responsible for postal delays or errors due to extreme weather conditions affecting the mail and\/or other factors that may impact postal delays both domestic and international.

It would be my pleasure to help you design your customized gift.  \n\nPersonalization is also available on any existing or new piece.  If you are in need of personalized wedding gifts, personalized groomsmen gifts, personalized bridesmaids gifts, personalized party favors, personalized glasses, or barware, send me your details, and I would be happy to work with you.  Personalized glassware is a great gift idea for any occasion.  \n\nWant a different shaped custom bar glass?

The address you have on file with Etsy is where I will ship your order. If you would like it to be delivered elsewhere, please let me know upon check out. Tax is automatically applied to Georgia residents only. Per Etsy guidelines, coupon codes cannot be combined.","policy_shipping":"Shipping charges are an estimate.  I charge exact shipping only to your destination.  Since most of my items cannot go first class, the charges vary by location.  If this charge is overstated for your location, I will promptly refund you the difference.  \r\n\r\nIf you are international, unfortunately I have no way of know how much, or if you will be charged custom fee&#39;s, or duty taxes.  Therefore, I am not responsible for any charges additional to the actual shipment charges incurred by the United States Post Office.  It is the international customers responsibility to pay any customs fee. taxes, VAT&#39;s, etc.  \r\n\r\nTURN AROUND TIME\r\nInstant gratification is always my goal.  For an accurate turn around time, please check the shipping tab on the listing. Those will be updated with current timing, as timing will vary based on stocked items vs. custom items.  Most of my items ship within 5-7 business days.  I strive to process sooner than stated, but I like to leave some wiggle room for my family. You will be contacted if there is a delay for any unforeseen reason. If you need something by a certain date, please let me know prior to ordering and I will do my best to accommodate. Orders are processed in the order they are received. \r\n\r\nFor orders requesting samples or orders which require proofs or clarification, production time begins when I have received all required information to proceed. Should you require customization with products not normally kept in stock, production times may be slightly longer.\r\n\r\nPACKAGING\r\nRest assured, there are no hidden costs in my shipping fees. Due to the fragile nature of my items, each package will arrive with multiple types of filler and packaging.  You will never be charged for my packaging materials.   I do try to &quot;be green&quot; whenever possible, and do recycle packaging materials when I can.  \r\n\r\nSometimes glass etched items will arrived with a smudged or streaked appearance.  I assure you this is not permanent.  This happens from fingerprints and moisture.  It is easily fixed by wetting the entire etched area and drying with a cloth.  It will be back to perfect.  \r\n\r\nUSPS MAIL\r\nI ship every order within the Unites States via USPS First Class mail when available, or USPS Priority mail if the package is over one pound. You will receive an email from Etsy once your order is processed with a USPS confirmation and tracking number. I ship to the address on your Etsy account unless otherwise noted, please make sure it is correct before your purchase.  My Dailey Creations is not responsible for misdirected mail due to an incorrect address given, or address undeliverable. \r\n\r\nUSPS shipping times will vary depending upon their current workload. Please allow at least 14 days from the date of shipment for US orders before assuming your package is lost. I will be happy to work with you to achieve an amicable resolution regarding non-delivered items.\r\n\r\nShipping discounts for multiple item orders are valid only when all items are being shipped to the same address. If your items need to be shipped to multiple addresses, a separate purchase must be made for each shipping address.\r\n\r\nProduction times will vary so please check the listing for current production times to make sure that your order will arrive within your required time frame.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\r\nDue to the fragile nature of my items, I cannot always ship international.  If you would like an international shipment, please contact me, and I would be happy to discuss the possibility.   If a package is shipped international, the buyer will be responsible for any duties, taxes or fees of any kind imposed by customs or any other authority in the destination country. Please check with your nearest customs office to inquire about any such charges. International buyers please allow up to eight weeks for your item to clear customs and be delivered to you.\r\n\r\nProduction times will vary so please check the listing for current production times to make sure that your order will arrive within your required time frame.
